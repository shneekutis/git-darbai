    With the July 27 release of Highway to Hell in 1979, AC/DC reached new heights of stardom. Replacing the Young brothers’ older sibling George in favor of a young Robert John “Mutt” Lange behind the boards, the band utilized their new producer’s high definition style to their utmost advantage. Kicking off with its pounding title track, Highway was ready-made for American kids already all hopped up on KISS, the Ramones and Cheap Trick. Songs like “Girls Got Rhythm,” “If You Want Blood (You’ve Got It)” and the writhing closing number “Night Prowler” perfected the balance between Angus Young’s blues-gnarling guitar work, the unstoppable rhythm machine of guitarist Malcolm Young, bassist Cliff Williams and drummer Phil Rudd, and the roguish hooliganism of lead singer Bon Scott.
    Sadly, Highway was the last AC/DC LP with Scott, who died the following February of alcohol poisoning. And while the great Brian Johnson’s equally enigmatic presence and vocal delivery on 1980’s Back In Black helped achieve arguably the most seamless transition of frontmen in rock history, Highway to Hell was pure lightning in a bottle; when Bon declares, “Hey Satan! Paid my dues playing in a rockin’ band” on that famous song, he was rewarded with a permanent seat among the immortals of the art — finding that rare off-ramp on the highway that leads right to Rock n’ Roll Heaven.
