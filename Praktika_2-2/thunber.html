    "Thunderstruck" is typical AC/DC hard rock material, but that doesn't mean it's bad by any stretch of the imagination. The song is about a celebration and having a good time, as it's often the case with most hard rock songs. Thunderstruck, however, specifically refers to the act of frightening a person out of the blue... in a good way. In other words, it's more of a pleasant surprise.

    There are other theories on the basis of the song, but that's what I think of it. Since a picture is worth a thousand words,I'll better describe the meaning of the song visually:
